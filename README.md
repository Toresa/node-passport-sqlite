# node-passport-sqlite
A project that uses sqlite as backend for storing user data. Get up and running in minutes without the use of database services.
Great if you don't have access to a database service like mysql or mongodb. Sqlite is filebased and supports light web traffic.
Notes:
After downloading the code to your computer you need to run 'npm install' from the installation folder to get the required packages (~30 Mb). Packages are not included in the code.
To see inside the database you will need a sqlite client, which can be found <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">here</a> or <a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html">here (command line)</a>
There is a user included already for demonstration purposes, user name is 'user' (no quotes) and password is 'password' (also no quotes).
Passwords are encrypted before saving to the database.

Note: This is for demonstation purposes only.
